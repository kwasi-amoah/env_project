# üåç Environment Impact of Food Production Analysis

## üìñ Project Overview
Food production is one of the most significant contributors to environmental degradation, including climate change, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. The agricultural sector‚Äôs footprint varies widely across food products, farming methods, and regions.  

This project analyzes the environmental impacts of food production using a dataset containing metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, land use, and eutrophication emissions. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, highlight sustainability challenges, and provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, environmentalists, food producers, and consumers.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset contains food products and their associated environmental impact metrics.  

### Example Columns:
- **Food Product**  
- **Production Stages**: Land use change, Animal Feed, Farm, Processing, Transport, Packaging, Retail  
- **Emissions**: Total Emissions, GHG per kcal, GHG per 100g protein, Eutrophying emissions  
- **Water Use**: Freshwater withdrawals (per kcal, per protein, per kg), Scarcity-weighted water use  
- **Land Use**: Land use (per kcal, per protein, per kg)  
- **Food Category**

## ‚ùì Business Questions
The analysis addresses questions such as:
1. Which food products contribute the most to total emissions?  
2. How do greenhouse gas emissions vary across different food categories?  
3. Which foods have the highest water withdrawals per kilogram or per protein unit?  
4. What is the land use distribution across major food products?  
5. Which production stage (farm, transport, packaging, etc.) contributes the most to emissions?  
6. How do different metrics (GHG, water, land use, eutrophication) compare across food categories?  
7. What sustainable recommendations can be made from the findings?
